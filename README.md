. Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): OOP revolutionized software development by emphasizing data encapsulation and inheritance, resulting in more reusable and flexible code.
. Agile Methodologies (1990s): Agile approaches like Scrum and Kanban emphasized iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability, making software development more responsive to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANS:
Requirement Gathering: This phase involves understanding the needs and expectations of the users or clients. It includes conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops to gather detailed requirements for the software.
. System Analysis: The collected requirements are analyzed to determine the best approach to meet the project goals. This involves creating system diagrams, flowcharts, and use case scenarios to visualize the software's functionality.
. System Design: The system analysis is used to create a detailed design for the software. This includes defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and data structures.
. Development: The design is implemented by writing code and creating the software's components. This phase involves using programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the software's functionality.
. Testing: The software is thoroughly tested to identify and fix any defects or errors. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
. Deployment: The completed software is deployed to the production environment, making it available to users. This may involve installing the software on servers, configuring settings, and providing user documentation.
. Maintenance: After deployment, the software is continuously monitored and updated to ensure its ongoing performance and reliability. This includes addressing bugs, adding new features, and making security updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS:
. Waterfall Methodology
Sequential: Follows a linear, phased approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Rigid: Less flexible in accommodating changes during development.
Detailed Planning: Requires extensive upfront planning and documentation.
Best suited for: Projects with well-defined requirements and minimal uncertainty, such as infrastructure projects or large-scale software systems.

. Agile Methodology
Iterative: Breaks down projects into smaller, incremental cycles (sprints).
Flexible: Adapts to changing requirements throughout the development process.
Customer-centric: Emphasizes continuous collaboration with stakeholders and frequent feedback.
Best suited for: Projects with evolving requirements, uncertain outcomes, or a need for rapid prototyping and iteration, such as software development in a dynamic market.
In summary, Waterfall is more suitable for projects with predictable requirements and a stable scope, while Agile is better suited for projects that require flexibility, adaptability, and frequent stakeholder involvement.
